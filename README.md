# RegulusProject

This repository is created for the development of the Regulus AI project

# Node and npm installation

The first and the most essential step in being able to run this project locally is installation of node.js and
npm. They are necessary to initiate the react application. The versions used in this repository are - node.js = v22.2.0
and npm=10.7.0. The link for downloading it is following -  https://nodejs.org/en/download/source-code.

After installation make sure that both of them are correct versions using: node -v and npm -v.

# Installation of all the dependencies

After both node and npm are ready to work, it means that we have nearly everything to make sure that npm is installed.

This project is divided in two pieces - backend and fronted (regulus-app). So all the further operations need to be
implemented after being sure that you are in the correct folder. Therefore, run cd regulus-app in your terminal. After
that, run npm install, so that you are gathering internally all the dependencies used in the project. You now should
be able to go through the src/components, where the pages of the web application are saved, and have no mistakes. If you
still see, that some dependencies are not installed, please use npm install dependency-name.

# Running the web page locally

Finally, run npm start from the regulus app folder to start the local server with the Regulus AI page.
